# JavaScript Function Invocation Methods: call, apply, and bind

## Introduction

In JavaScript, functions can be invoked in different ways. The most common way is to simply call the function with the desired arguments. However, there are three other methods that can be used to invoke functions: `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`. These methods allow you to control the context in which a function is executed, and they can be useful for a variety of purposes.

## Function Invocation Methods

### 1. The `call()` Method

The `call()` method allows you to specify the context in which a function is executed. The first argument to `call()` is the context object, and the remaining arguments are the arguments that will be passed to the function.

For example, the following code uses the `call()` method to invoke the `newf()` function with the `obj` object as the context object:

```javascript
function newf(val1, val2, val3) {
  console.log(this.age, val1, val2, val3);
}

var obj = {
  age: 24,
};

newf.call(obj, 1, 2, 3);
```

This code will output the following to the console:

```
24 1 2 3
```

As you can see, the `this` keyword inside the `newf()` function refers to the `obj` object, which is the context object that was specified in the `call()` method.

### 2. The `apply()` Method

The `apply()` method is similar to the `call()` method, but it takes an array of arguments instead of individual arguments. The first argument to `apply()` is the context object, and the second argument is an array of arguments that will be passed to the function.

For example, the following code uses the `apply()` method to invoke the `newf()` function with the `obj` object as the context object and the `[1, 2, 3]` array as the arguments:

```javascript
newf.apply(obj, [1, 2, 3]);
```

This code will output the same result as the previous example:

```
24 1 2 3
```

### 3. The `bind()` Method

The `bind()` method creates a new function that is bound
